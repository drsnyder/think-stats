(defn dance-party
  "5.7: In the BRFSS (see Section 4.5), the distribution of heights is roughly normal with
  parameters μ=178cm and σ2=59.4cm for men, and μ=163cm and σ2 = 52.8 cm for women.

  One way to determine this probability is to simulate pairing p partners and count the number of occurences where
  the height of the woman and greater than the height of the male. For more accuracy we could simulate this n times
  and take the mean.

  I wanted to confirm this result analytically, but I wasn't sure how. I later found this:
  http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/24693/probability-that-random-variable-b-is-greater-than-random-variable-a
  which confirmed the simulated result.
